# Lab 5 - Ace your interview with Copilot Chat

Imagine you're interviewing for position at Contoso, a mid-sized media-driven company. You've been communicating with the hiring manager via email. Now, you want to prepare for the interview, learn more about the team you'll be working with, and draft answers to potential questions that you may be asked. This Lab guides you through the steps to ensure you're well-prepared and confident.

> [!NOTE]
> The steps in this Lab provide guidance on how to navigate and prompt Copilot Chat in Teams. Follow along, using your own Teams resources to complete each step.

#### Exercise 1 - Research the interviewer

Use Copilot Chat in Teams to gather some insights about the interviewer and their role. This research helps you get a better sense of who you'll be speaking with and what their responsibilities are. It's always good to know a bit about the person on the other side of the table!

1. Open Microsoft Teams by navigating to the following URL +++https://teams.microsoft.com+++.

1. Select the **Copilot Chat** icon on the left side of the screen.

1. Make sure the toggle at the top of the screen is set to **Web**.

1. Prompt Copilot with:

    +++Find information about [Interviewer's Name] and their role at [Contoso].+++

    **Note:** Replace [Interviewer's Name] with the name of the person you're interviewing with, and [Contoso] with the name of the company.

1. Review the information provided by Copilot.

#### Exercise 2 - Research the department

Now, let's use Copilot Chat to research the department you're applying to. Imagine you're applying to the Marketing Innovations Department at Contoso.

1. In the same chat with Copilot, enter the following prompt:

    +++Provide me with an overview of [Contoso]. Can you tell me about their [research] department?+++

1. Review the information provided by Copilot.

#### Exercise 3 - Generate anticipated questions

As you learn about the company, you see this position could be a great opportunity for you. To make sure that you can navigate the actual interview with confidence, you can use Copilot Chat to brainstorm and generate potential questions the interviewer might ask. Think of it like a friendly sparring session with a trusted coach, where you get to tackle possible questions and refine your answers.

1. Continue in Copilot Chat.

1. Enter the following prompt:

    +++Generate a list of potential questions I may be asked in the interview.+++

1. Review and refine the list of questions provided by Copilot.

#### Exercise 4 - Generate answers

Now that you've got an idea of potential questions, you can consider your personal responses. To help craft answers that align with the department's messaging and your personal voice, you can use Copilot Chat to generate answers for each anticipated question.

1. In the same Copilot Chat, prompt Copilot to

    +++Draft answers for the questions in the previous response.+++

    Because Copilot Chat is an iterative experience, it considers the context of previous chat interactions in the same window.

1. Review and edit the answers provided by Copilot to ensure they align with Contoso's internal messaging and your personal experiences.

#### Exercise 5 - Create an FAQ document

These answers are great, and you're feeling confident before your interview. Now, let's create a single source of truth to reference at a later point. Use Copilot to compile the questions and answers into an FAQ Word document.

1. In the same Copilot Chat window, prompt Copilot to:

    +++Create a Word .docx document with this output.+++

    Copilot generates a new Word document titled **FAQ Document**.

1. Open this document to review.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If prompted, log in using the same credentials you provided when you logged in to OneDrive.

1. Enable editing to verify and updatae the document as necessary.

1. Select **File > Save As**. Browse and navigate to your OneDrive folder.

1. Save the document as **FAQ Document**.

#### (Optional) Exercise 6 - Send a thank you email using Copilot in Outlook

1. Open Outlook and select **New email** button to start composing your thank you note.

1. Select the Copilot icon in the email composition window so Copilot can help draft your thank you note.

1. Enter a prompt such as:

    +++I need help with drafting a thank you note for a recent interview.+++

    Copilot  generates a draft for you.
