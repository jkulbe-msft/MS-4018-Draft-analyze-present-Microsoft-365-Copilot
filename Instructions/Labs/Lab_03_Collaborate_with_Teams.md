# Lab 3 - Manage collaboration from start to finish

Imagine you're a manager at Contoso. Your team relies on effective communication to collaborate and achieve goals. You want to rally the team behind a new idea for the Contoso Connect product launch, and need to send a message to your team about how to incorporate this idea before the product launch deadline. Use Copilot to draft, rewrite, and adjust your message to ensure it's clear, concise, and professional.

#### Exercise 1 - Write an engaging message to introduce your idea

1. Open Microsoft Teams by navigating to the following URL +++https://teams.cloud.microsoft+++.

1. To start, create a new Team in your team's chat for this conversation. Select **New Team** from the Chat dropdown menu.

    - Add the Team:  +++People and Culture+++
    - Description: leave blank
    - Team Type: **Private**
    - First channel name: +++Contoso Connect+++

1. Select **Create**, then when prompted to add members select **Skip**.

1. Select **Post in channel** to open the message window.

1. Write your message in the box at the bottom of the chat or channel. Copy and paste the following text into the dialog box:

   +++Hi Team! I've been thinking about Contoso Connect, and how we can make the product launch more exciting for our customers. I have a couple of ideas, and want to hear more from each of you. What do you think would make our customers excited and ready to work with Connect?+++

1. Before you post the message, select the **Rewrite with Copilot** icon at the bottom of the message box.

1. Choose the **Rewrite** option to generate another version of your message that improves its grammar and style. You can rewrite your message up to 10 times, each time generating a new version. Use the left and right arrows below the text to navigate through versions.

1. While this message is adequate, it lacks the enthusiasm you're trying to convey.

1. Select **Adjust** then select from the options Copilot presents to edit and update your message. You can customize the message if it's still not right.

1. Select **Custom** from the **Adjust** option. Try custom tones like +++instructive+++ or +++engaging+++. Select the right arrow button to submit the change.

1. Select **Replace** when you're satisfied with the new message. If you selected a partial section, only that text updates.

1. Once you replace the original message, select **Post**.

The team receives your message and is excited to contribute! Everyone contributes ideas and discusses potential issues in the Teams chat.

#### Exercise 2 - Schedule a meeting in Outlook

You now want to schedule a meeting to brainstorm some feedback with your team. You can use Copilot in Outlook to find the best time based on your team's availability, and draft the body of the meeting invite to include the key points you prompted Copilot to answer from your meeting chat.

1. Open Microsoft Outlook from your browser by entering +++https://outlook.office.com+++.

1. Select the **Copilot** icon from the **Home** ribbon to open the Copilot pane.

1. Ask Copilot to suggest the best time for the meeting by entering the following prompt:

    +++Draft a meeting invitation to discuss the upcoming product launch, review the project timeline, and assign tasks.+++

1. Copilot creates a draft of the meeting invite. Review the suggestion then enter the following prompt:

    +++Rewrite this email in a professional tone.+++

1. Review Copilot's suggestion and select to **Keep it**.

After you've created your draft, you can continue to prompt Copilot assist you in scheduling the meeting based on your availability next week. Copilot suggests several time slots. You can select the time that best works.  Copilot adds the meeting to your calendar. You can then access the meeting details from you calendar and invite attendees, turn on the Facilitator for the meeting, and allow Copilot to reschedule the meeting if conflicts arise.

By using Copilot in Team's capabilities, you can effortlessly draft, rewrite, and adjust messages, gather insights from team chats, and schedule meetings efficiently. Now, you can confidently use these tools to streamline your workflow and achieve your collaboration goals with ease.
